## Empowering Your Development with FP: Understanding and Practice

There are a lot of talks about the newest tools libraries and frameworks but sometimes it is good to take a step back and think about the underlying problems they are trying to solve. In this talk we will go into the 4 fundamental aspects within software engineering; problem solving, managing state, managing errors and managing side effects. There will be almost no functional programming terminology used but instead focus on recognizable examples (in Java) and look at them from a different angle that you might have never concidered. So if you want to improve your problem solving skills and get better in abstract thinking without having to learn what a monad is, this is the talk for you.

## Functional programming in Kotlin: exploring Arrow

Functional programming is gaining popularity and partly because of this people have been switching to Kotlin.
Although it fits the paradigm better than Java, there is still quite a bit missing to unleash the full power of FP.
Arrow is here to fill in the missing bits with things like new datatypes, e.g. Try, Either, and Optics. Arrow is the most popular functional programming library for Kotlin.
In this talk we will go through what problems Arrow can solve for you and how it can help you with your everyday programming.

## Java's new paradigm

The new Java features like records, sealed classes and pattern matching have all been added to support the Data Oriënted Programming paradigm.
But what is the idea behind it and what makes it different from the Object Oriënted style or the Functional Programming style?
In this talk we will go into what Data Oriënted Programming is, what mindset you need for it and we will take a look at some Data Oriënted Programming patterns.
So if you want to be ready to code modern Java and would like to add another tool to your toolbox, this is the talk is the right talk for you.
