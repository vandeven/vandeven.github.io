## Creepy Crawly Chronicles

(Joint presentation with <a href="https://mostlynerdless.de/">Johannes Bechberger</a> & <a href="https://maritvandijk.com/">Marit van Dijk</a>)

When attending conferences, we mostly hear success stories of problems solved with new and trendy technologies. And while success stories are nice, it can be more educational and fun to see how things can catastrophically go wrong and what we can learn from these failures.
In this talk, we will discuss (in)famous bugs found in the wild, ranging from strange inconveniences to bugs that rigged elections, bankrupt companies, or made things literally explode.

## Empowering Your Development with FP: Understanding and Practice

There are a lot of talks about the newest tools libraries and frameworks but sometimes it is good to take a step back and think about the underlying problems they are trying to solve. In this talk we will go into the 4 fundamental aspects within software engineering; problem solving and managing state, errors and side effects. We will offer solutions and trade-offs (so no silver bullets) and you might learn some tricks for problem solving as well. This talk will contain a bit of theory, but we will mostly focus on the practical side so you can use the given solutions in your code-base tomorrow.

## Functional programming in Kotlin: exploring Arrow

Functional programming is gaining popularity and partly because of this people have been switching to Kotlin.
Although it fits the paradigm better than Java, there is still quite a bit missing to unleash the full power of FP.
Arrow is here to fill in the missing bits with things like new datatypes, e.g. Try, Either, and Optics. Arrow is the most popular functional programming library for Kotlin.
In this talk we will go through what problems Arrow can solve for you and how it can help you with your everyday programming.

## Java's new paradigm

The new Java features like records, sealed classes and pattern matching have all been added to support the Data Oriënted Programming paradigm.
But what is the idea behind it and what makes it different from the Object Oriënted style or the Functional Programming style?
In this talk we will go into what Data Oriënted Programming is, what mindset you need for it and we will take a look at some Data Oriënted Programming patterns.
So if you want to be ready to code modern Java and would like to add another tool to your toolbox, this is the talk is the right talk for you.
