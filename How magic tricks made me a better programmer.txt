How magic tricks made me a better programmer:

- amateur magician

> Show aces trick (live)

> Explain aces (live)

- Devoxx4kids

> Break down aces (composition diagram)

- programming
- Contract

- Tease trick at the end


> Show triumph (live)
- Now you have 10 minutes left to figure out how I did that
- If you get it right you get a waffle
